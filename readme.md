# Voice 2 GPT - voice chat with OpenAI ChatGPT model

This project is focused on voice communication with ChatGPT.

The **user speaks into the computer's microphone**, and the application **transforms the audio recording into text using the
OpenAI Whisper** service.
Then, if necessary, this text is translated into English (this functionality is not yet implemented).
**Afterwards, the OpenAI Chat service API is called**, using the 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0301' model. **The response is then transformed
back into audio using the built-in sound synthesis support in the MS Windows operating system**.

(Note: It is recommended to have this (Speech support in windows) support installed for the language you are communicating in,
otherwise the output will not work. To check if the support is installed, go to settings -> time & language -> speech ->
installed voice packages.
You can also use the `list-voices` command to list all available voices. Like this: `voice2gpt list-voices`)

**ðŸ›‘ DISCLAIMER: This project was created in my spare time during 2 evenings just for fun. Do not ask me to make urgent
fixes or add new features. I may consider it, but I cannot promise anything. My time is limited. I have a job, a family,
dog, garden, etc.**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. You have installed the version of .NET Core SDK 7.0 or higher.

        ```

2. Windows 10 or higher

The **OpenAI API** key (`OpenAIServiceOptions:ApiKey`) and organization key
(`OpenAIServiceOptions:OrgKey`) can be obtained by registering at https://platform.openai.com/
and creating a new API key. The organization key is not required, but it is recommended to use
it to avoid rate limiting. You can find the organization key at https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings.
